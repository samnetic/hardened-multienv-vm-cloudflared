# Minimal Alertmanager config (safe default: no external notifications).
#
# To enable notifications, add receivers (Slack, email, PagerDuty, webhook, ntfy, etc.)
# and update the route below.
#
# Docs: https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/

global: {}

route:
  receiver: "null"
  group_by: ["alertname", "job", "instance"]
  group_wait: 30s
  group_interval: 5m
  repeat_interval: 4h

receivers:
  - name: "null"

  # Example: ntfy (easy, fast alerting)
  #
  # 1) Create a topic (or choose a random one):
  #    https://ntfy.sh/<topic>
  # 2) Switch route.receiver to "ntfy"
  #
  # - name: "ntfy"
  #   webhook_configs:
  #     - url: "https://ntfy.sh/<your-topic>"
  #       send_resolved: true
