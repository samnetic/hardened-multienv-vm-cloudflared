# Prometheus config (monitoring VPS)
#
# This default config is intentionally "quiet":
# - scrapes Prometheus itself only
# - ships alert rules, but they will not fire until you add targets
#
# To scrape app VPS metrics through Cloudflare Access Service Auth:
# - copy configs/prometheus.yml.example and customize targets
# - ensure CF Access service token secrets are created on the monitoring VPS
