# =================================================================
# Kernel Module Blacklist (Optional Hardening)
# =================================================================
# Copy to: /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-unused.conf
#
# Purpose: reduce kernel attack surface on a headless cloud VM by preventing
# loading of rarely-needed device stacks.
#
# Notes:
# - Blacklisting does NOT unload already-loaded modules.
# - Prefer doing this only on dedicated servers/VPS where you control hardware.
# - If something breaks, remove this file and reboot.
# =================================================================

# Bluetooth (not used on servers)
blacklist bluetooth
blacklist btusb

# Firewire (not used on servers)
blacklist firewire-core
blacklist firewire-ohci

# USB storage (usually not present on cloud VMs)
blacklist usb-storage
